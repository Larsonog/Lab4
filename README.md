INTENT OF GAME + NARRATIVE STRUCTURE 

We made a first-person shooter game (FPS) with marbles. In the game the user is a part of the Marble Police Force and is trying to go after the Marble Mafia. Starting on the first floor, it is the user's goal to fight their way up to the top floor for the final battle. The user must defend themselves from the Marble Mafia boss’s henchmen.  

MECHANICS + AESTHETICS 

The user uses WASD and controller input for movement in all directions. The mouse is used to move the camera and to fire marbles at the enemy. We chose to make our game in 3D to challenge ourselves. While the location is a mystery, the user does know that they are in a building with tiled floors and brick walls. This is a simple building aesthetic. There are no additional objects, besides a maze on the second floor, because we really wanted to focus on the mechanics of the enemy mafia pursuers and their ability to go around objects. We also didn’t want to make this game too detailed, so we kept the mafia member as lightly textured pill shaped beings.  

JOYS AND STRUGGLES 

It was fun getting to work with the 3D part of Unity. While it was similar to Unity in 2D there was a bit of a learning curve that required additional research. One issue we were never able to quite fix was the player being able to clip through walls. We tried several methods of moving the player but nothing seemed to make a difference.

CONTRIBUTIONS BY TEAM MEMBERS  

There was a lot of crossover of contributions between team members. Ivy started work on the enemies, making it so they could shoot out marbles, and then Ian made the enemies follow the user and made them each shoot on a timer. Ian made the Health bar and added in the crosshairs for the user to aim the marble gun. Olivia added in the sound for the gun and created the building with the brick wall texture and tiled floor. Ivy made the Main Menu and fixed a lot of the bugs in the project.
